Or want to check if the door is open? Smart_Home is here to help! Reed switches turn on (or off depending on type) when a magnet is nearby. Using them you can easily check if something is in right position (e.g. the door is closed). By following this Wiki you should be able to check states of these switches from anywhere you want. First step In order to use reed switches with Smart_Home, you need to upload this code to your ESP (or compatible) board. Steps in doing this are the same as in uploading the regular firmware . Second step Wire reed switch to your ESP (or compatible) according to this schematic: Or, if you're more familiar with diagrams: Third step If you want, you can place the elements on a PCB. Here are ready to use gerber files . Fourth step If you have access to 3D Printer, you can download gcode here and print the case. If you need more help with that you can always message us at our . After doing all above steps, you can plug-in your board and open Arduino IDE Serial Monitor to check if everything is working correctly. With that all done your board is ready to send data to your Smart_Home web server. If you need help with that, read Creating web server Wiki.
